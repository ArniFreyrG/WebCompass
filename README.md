# WebCompass

The Chrome extension that points you in the right direction!

To use just upload all files through chrome://extensions/ "Load unpacked extension"

Web Compass uses your ip to find your current latitude/longitude coordinates, as well as those on the website you are visiting. It then gently turns the website to point to its geographical position, to ensure that YOU, the user, will have as realistic a browsing experience as possible.

NOTE: The Earth is ROUND, not flat, so directions may seem unintuitive. All directions are "as the bird flies".
